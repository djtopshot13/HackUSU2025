# **Insights throughout the project**
## What factors are most likely to influence a player to transfer from their current school?
According to our xgboost model, the factors (and their corresponding MSE) most likely to influence a player's transfer decision is their destination school's 2023 win percentage (0.9157), their destination school's NIL collective amount (.0241), their original school's NIL collective amount (0.0102), and their position (0.0101). 

## Which schools lose/gain the most players from the transfer portal?
The top five schools that lose the most players through the transfer portal are Colorado, Tennessee, Mississippi State, Florida State, and Ole Miss. The top five schools that gain the most players through the transfer portal are Texas State, Colorado, SMU, UMASS, and Arizona State. Interestingly enough, two of these schools (SMU and Arizona State) made their first-ever College Football Playoff appearances with rosters built largely from transfer portal players. 

## Which USU players are at risk of transferring according to our model?
